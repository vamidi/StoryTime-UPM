## Dialogue Anatomy <a href="#dialogue-anatomy" id="dialogue-anatomy"></a>

Dialogues are a part of the story life-cycle. In order to create dialogues for you character you have to do the following.

```
$ give me super-powers
```

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
