# Localization

{% hint style="info" %}
Unity has provided us with the amazing package to have localization in StoryTime.

See their [package](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.localization@1.0/manual/index.html) for more how it works.

{% hint style="danger" %}
We've made use of the newly created `com.unity.localization` package, double check if this is not installed after loading the StoryTime package.&#x20;
